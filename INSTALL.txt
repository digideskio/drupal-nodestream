REQUIREMENTS
------------

NodeStream is distributed with one .make file and one .profile file. The
.make file defines what packages that must be downloaded and the .profile file
is responsible for configuring all those modules.

To run this .make file you need two things:

 * Drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush)
 * Drush Make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make)

For instructions on how to install those packages, please consult their
respective documentation.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. DOWNLOAD NODESTREAM

   Currently NodeStream can only be fetched directly from the CVS repository.
   This is because of incompatibility with the packaging system on drupal.org.
   To fetch NodeStream from CVS follow the instructions on this page:

   http://drupal.org/node/891490/cvs-instructions

   Fetching NodeStream from CVS will create a directory containing only the
   .make file, the .profile file and some include files. In the following
   examples we assume this drectory is called nodestream/.

2. MOVE NODESTREAM INTO THE PROFILE FOLDER IN YOUR WEBROOT

   First we need to create a folder called profiles/ inside your web root and
   and move the nodestream/ folder there. In this example we assume your have an
   empty web root folder located at /var/www/html/.

     mkdir /var/www/html/profiles
     mv nodestream /var/www/html/profiles

3. RUN THE MAKE FILE TO DOWNLOAD ALL REQUIRED PACKAGES

   To run the .make file you must be located at the web root. Run the following
   commands:

     cd /var/www/html
     drush make profiles/nodestream/nodestream.make

4. CONTINUE INSTALLING NODESTREAM AS A REGULAR DRUPAL SITE

   From now on, the steps to get your site up and running is the same as with a
   regular Drupal site. Please consult the Drupal installation instructions from
   step 2 in /var/www/html/INSTALL.txt
